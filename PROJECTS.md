In this document we list all known projects around EMBA and EMBArk. Feel free to open issues or a pull request to list your project also in here.

## EMBA builder

This repository contains code to automate building a dedicated VM for [EMBA](https://www.securefirmware.de/). As EMBA runs best on [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), it uses Kali's own [build script for VM images](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-vm/) and modifies it to install EMBA.
